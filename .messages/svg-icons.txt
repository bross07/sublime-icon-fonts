SVG Icons
=========

Since web-developers are now slowly moving away from icon fonts to SVG icons,
Evil Icons and Octicons v5 have been removed from this package and added to a
new one:

https://github.com/idleberg/sublime-svg-icons

On that occasion, Octicons v4 are available again through this package. Sorry
for the inconvenience!
